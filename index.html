          <h2 class="title">History of West Bengal</h2>
          <p>
            The region was a part of several ancient pan-Indian empires,
            including the Mauryans and Guptas. It was also a bastion of regional
            kingdoms. The citadel of Gauda served as capital of the Gauda
            Kingdom, the Buddhist Pala Empire (eighth to 11th century) and Sena
            Empire (11thâ€“12th century). This era saw the development of Bengali
            language, script, literature, music, art and architecture. The
            Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent absorbed Bengal into the
            medieval Islamic and Persianate worlds. Between the 1204 and 1352,
            Bengal was a province of the Delhi Sultanate. This era saw the
            introduction of the taka as monetary currency, which has endured
            into the modern era. An independent Bengal Sultanate was formed in
            1352 and ruled the region for two centuries, during which a distinct
            form of Islam based on Sufism and the Bengali language emerged and
            the region was known as a major trading nation in the world. The
            ruling elite also turned Bengal into the easternmost haven of
            Indo-Persian culture. The Sultans exerted influence in the Arakan
            region of Southeast Asia, where Buddhist kings copied the
            sultanate's governance, currency and fashion. A relationship with
            Ming China flourished under the sultanate. The Bengal Sultanate was
            notable for its Hindu aristocracy, including the rise of Raja
            Ganesha and his son Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah as usurpers. Hindus
            served in the royal administration as prime ministers and poets.
            Under the patronage of Sultans like Alauddin Hussain Shah, Bengali
            literature began replacing the strong influence of Sanskrit in the
            region. Hindu principalities included the Kingdom of Mallabhum,
            Kingdom of Bhurshut and Kingdom of Tripura; and the realm of
            powerful Hindu Rajas such as Pratapaditya, Kedar Ray and Raja
            Sitaram Ray. Following the decline of the sultanate, Bengal came
            under the suzerainty of the Mughal Empire, as its wealthiest
            province. The gradual decline of the Mughal Empire led to
            quasi-independent states under the Nawabs of Bengal, subsequent to
            the Maratha invasions of Bengal, and finally the conquest by the
            British East India Company.
