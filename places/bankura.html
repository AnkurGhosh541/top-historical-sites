          <h2 class="title">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The origins of the Rajas of Bishnupur is somewhat clouded in
            mystery. According to O'Malley, all through the centuries, they were
            acknowledged as the kings of Bagdis. However, the Rajas of Bishnupur
            and many of their followers have laid claims to their being
            Kshatriyas linked to the Kshatriya clans of northern India. The
            claims seem to have originated or gathered momentum at a later
            period when assimilation of the region with the Proto-Indo-Europeans
            gained firm roots. The Rajas of Bishnupur were also known as Malla
            kings. Malla is a Sanskrit word meaning wrestler but there could be
            some links with the Mal tribes of the area, who had an intimate
            connection with the Bagdis.

          <h2 class="title">Rasmancha</h2>
          <p>
            The Rasmancha is a historical temple located at Bishnupur, Bankura
            district, West Bengal, India. It was commissioned by Mallabhum king
            Hambir Malla Dev (Bir Hambir) in 1600 CE. Length and breadth of this
            temple is 24.5 meter and the height is 12.5 meter. The base or altar
            of the temple is made of laterite stone and upper part is made with
            bricks. Upper structure looks like a pyramid. Middle part resembles
            Bengali huts and the arches of the lower part resembles Islamic
            architecture. During the Vaishnava Ras festival, all the Radha
            Krishna idols of Bishnupur town used to be brought here to be
            worshipped by the citizens. The annual festival was held till 1932.
            <br /><br />
            Rasmancha in Bishnupur, West Bengal is one such historical building.
            Established in 1600 AD by the King Hambhir, the Rasmancha was used
            to display all the local idols in public during the Ras Festival
            which stopped in 1932. The popular festival has been shifted to
            grounds near a Durga temple. Rasmancha temple stands on a raised
            square laterite plinth with a pyramidal superstructure. Three
            successive circumblatory galleries, The arches of which are
            decorated with terracotta lotus motifs.

          <h2 class="title">Jor Bangla Temple</h2>
          <p>
            Jor-bangla Temple is also known as ‘Yorubangala’. This temple is
            designed as per Hindu temple architecture that arose in Bengal. The
            style involves two structures that resemble the traditional village
            huts of the region, one that serves as a porch, in front of the
            other that serves as a shrine. Each structure has a roof of the
            ek-bangla (or do-chala) style, with two curved segments that meet at
            a curved ridge. Jor Bangla Mandir is one of the few temples of
            Bishnupur which is in good condition. The fondness with which my
            guide explained the Jor Bangla Mandir, I could make out it was his
            favorite Chala style temple. I too felt this is one of the must see
            temples of Bishnupur. The terracotta panels are undamaged and effect
            of wearing out is not prominent yet. It was built by Raghunath
            Singha II in 1655 A.D. The temple platform is squarish and measures
            12m by 12m we were told. These panels have detailed scenes from the
            Mahabharata, Ramayana and Krishna-Leela. The prayer room was shut.
            It houses the idol of Shadbhuja (6 hands) of Shri Chaitanya. The
            idol is not worshiped anymore.
            <br /><br />
            The do-chala (two roofs) style was used by Muslims and exported to
            other parts of India. The 17th century architecture of Delhi,
            Lahore, Gulbarg has monuments with this style. By 18th century this
            style became popular in parts of Rajasthan and can be seen in the
            palace balconie sand garden pavilions there. There is another ‘Chala
            style’ temple which I hope to see in future and that is in
            Bangladesh. It is the ‘Gopinath Jor-Bangla’, a Hindu temple located
            1km (0.62 mi) east of Pabna District in Bangladesh.

          <h2 class="title">Shyam Rai Temple</h2>
          <p>
            Shyam Rai Temple of Bishnupur, the oldest temple built in this
            style, is also one of the best examples of Pancha Ratna Style of
            architecture. Built in 1643, the Shyam Rai Temple is also one of the
            earliest temples of Bishnupur. Built by Malla ruler Raghunath
            Singha, the building is an exquisite example of medieval Bengali art
            & architecture. Built entirely with clay bricks and clad in burnt
            clay(terracotta) tiles, Shaym Rai Temple is a marvel both in terms
            of its design and construction.
            <br /><br />
            Like most of the temples in Bishnupur, this temple is also dedicated
            to Lord Sri Krishna and Sri Radha. The name Shyam (Krishna) – Rai
            (Radha) has been derived from the colloquial names of the Hindu Lord
            and his lovers. The temple is square in plan with a dimension of
            11.4 meters each side. Each of the sides has three arched gateways
            in the centre and elaborate terracotta carvings on the entire
            surface. The roof of the building is flat curved ‘Chala’ type – a
            unique feature of Bengali Architecture. Above the roof rises five
            beautiful pinnacles – giving the name Pancha Ratna. While Rasmancha,
            the only temple built before the Shyam Rai temple, has a very high
            plinth (It can also be found in temples built later), this temple
            has a very low plinth.

          <h2 class="title">Mrinmoyee Temple</h2>
          <p>
            Mrinmoyee Temple is dedicated to Goddess Durga and is situated in
            Bishnupur at Bankura district. It is a very old temple and is rich
            in heritage. Durga Puja which is observed every year in this temple
            is over 1000 years old. It is unbelievable, but true. It gets this
            name because of the fact that the Malla dynasty used to rule then
            and it was under their governance that this temple came up. It is
            the oldest Durga Puja in Bengal and it still beholds its rich
            culture, in an undiluted way.
            <br /><br />
            Raghunath was crowned as the first king of Malla dynasty at
            Pradamnapur. King Jagat Malla shifted his capital from Pradamnapur
            to Bishnupur because of the latter’s better positioning with respect
            to safety. Bishnupur is mostly famous for its terracotta tradition,
            but it also proudly is the place where the oldest Durga Puja of the
            state happens. King Jagat Malla established the Mrinmoyee temple in
            997 AD. Actually, Jagat Malla was ordered by Maa Mrinmoyee to build
            this temple, in his dreams. The idol is made of Ganga clay. The 57th
            generation of the Malla dynasty is there at present.
