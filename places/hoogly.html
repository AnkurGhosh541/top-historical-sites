          <h2 class="title">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The Portuguese traders started slave trading, robbery and converting
            natives into Christians by pressure. At one point they stopped
            paying taxes to the Mughal Empire. As a result, Emperor Shah Jahan
            ordered the then-ruler of Bengal province, Qasim Khan Juvayni, to
            block the city of Hooghly. This led to a war in which the Portuguese
            were defeated. Among other European powers that came to Hooghly were
            the Dutch, the Danish, the British, the French, the Belgians and the
            Germans. Dutch traders centred their activities in the town Chuchura
            which is south of Hooghly. Chandannagar became the base of the
            French and the city remained under their control from 1816 to 1950.
            Similarly, the Danish establishment in settlement in Serampore
            (1755). All these towns are on the west bank of the Hooghly River
            and served as ports. Among these European countries, the British
            ultimately became most powerful.
            <br /><br />
            Initially the British were based in and around the city of Hooghly
            like traders from other countries. In 1690 Job Charnock decided to
            shift the British trading centre from Hooghly-Chinsura to Calcutta.
            The reason behind this decision was the strategically safe location
            of Calcutta and its proximity to the Bay of Bengal. As a result,
            trade and commerce in the Bengal province shifted from the town of
            Hooghly to Calcutta. Hooghly lost its importance as Calcutta
            prospered. After the Battle of Buxar this region was brought under
            direct British rule until India's independence in 1947. After
            independence, this district merged into the state of West Bengal.

          <h2 class="title">Bandel Church</h2>
          <p>
            The Basilica of the Holy Rosary (commonly known as Bandel Church) is
            one of the oldest Christian churches in West Bengal, India. Situated
            in Bandel, Hooghly district of West Bengal, it stands as a memorial
            to the Portuguese settlement in Bengal. Founded in 1599, it is
            dedicated to Nossa Senhora do Rosário, Our Lady of the Rosary. It is
            also a parish church, part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of
            Calcutta. It is one of the most prominent historical churches in
            West Bengal as well as in India.
            <br /><br />
            Around the middle of the 16th century, the Portuguese began using
            Bandel as a port. During or around 1571, they were given permission
            by Akbar, the Mughal emperor, to build a town in Hooghly. As they
            began settling around the area, their priests began to baptise the
            natives - by 1598, Catholics in Hooghly numbered around five
            thousand, including natives and mixed races. In 1579, the Portuguese
            built a port on the banks of the Hooghly, as well as a fort named
            Fort Ugolim, and enlisted the services of a band of Augustinian
            Friars, then the largest religious body in Goa. The following year,
            Captain Pedro Tavares obtained the emperor's full permission to
            preach the Catholic faith publicly, and erect churches. Thus the
            Bandel Church came to be constructed in 1599. This first church was
            burnt down during the sacking of Hooghly by the Moors in 1632. A
            newer church, constructed by Gomez de Soto (also spelt John Comes de
            Soto), was built over the ruin in 1660. The keystone of the older
            church can still be seen on the eastern gate of the monastery,
            bearing the date 1599. On November 25, 1988, Pope John Paul II
            declared the sanctuary a minor basilica.

          <h2 class="title">Hoogly Imamabara</h2>
          <p>
            Hooghly Imambara is a Shia Muslim congregation hall and mosque in
            Hooghly, West Bengal, India. The construction of the building was
            started by Muhammad Mohsin in 1841 and completed in 1861. The
            building is a two storied structure, with a tall clock tower over
            the entrance gate. The mosque has intricate designs and texts from
            Quran engraved on the wall. The interior of the mosque is decorated
            with marbles, candles and hanging lanterns.
            <br /><br />
            The Hooghly Imambara was set up by a distinguished Persian merchant
            named Mohammad Aga Motahar in 1717 AD. He had arrived at the banks
            of river Hooghly at the beginning of 18th century with his salt
            business. He built his abode at the place where the Imambara stands
            today for his family with the desire to spend the rest of his life.
            Being a rich person, he enjoyed the service of a large number of
            servants. But perhaps, his family life was not a happy one although
            he was blessed with immense wealth. In 1717, he dedicated his loved
            home solely to the almighty God “Allah” and renamed the place as
            “Nazargah Hossein”. In 1735, his son-in-law Mirza Saleh-ud-din added
            another building to it. This new building was named “Tazia Khana”,
            this is probably the place where the Tazias are kept.

          <h2 class="title">Hanseswari Temple</h2>
          <p>
            In 1673, Zamindar Rameshwar Ray left Patuli and settled in Bansberia
            or Banskabati as it was known earlier in Hooghly. Bansberia is
            located besides our holy river Ganga, and in between Tribeni and
            Bandel. Zamindar Rameshwar Ray was gifted this village of around 400
            Bigha of Land and its Zamindari by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb who
            also gifted him the prestigious title of King. From this time onward
            many of his kith and kin settled in Bansberia.The Hanseswari temple
            was built in the beginning of the 19th century. The main deity is
            the blue neem-wood idol of the four-armed goddess Hanseswari, a
            manifestation of Goddess Kali. The temple is 21 meter high and has
            13 towers. The peak of each tower is shaped as a lotus flower. Built
            according to Tantric principles, this five-storey shrine follows the
            structure of a human body – Ira, Pingala, Bajraksha, Sushumna and
            Chitrini.
            <br /><br />
            The temple complex has another temple— Ananta Basudeba temple —
            besides the main temple. There is also the Swanbhaba Kali temple
            nearby built by Raja Nrisinhadeb Roy Mahasay in 1788. This temple
            too holds a very special position as a terracotta temple with
            exquisite terracotta works on it.The Hanseswari temple has a
            distinctive architecture different from the usual pattern present in
            this area, consisting 13 minars or ratnas, each built as a blooming
            lotus bud. The inner structure of the building resembles human
            anatomy. It was started by Raja Nrishinghadeb Roy and later
            completed by his wife Rani Shankari. According to a legend King
            Nrisingha Dev Rai, while staying in Varanasi during the year 1792 to
            1798 learnt deeply “Kundalini” and “Six cyclic centers (Six
            Chakras)” in the human system. Cancelling his plan to visit Britain
            he endeavored to build a temple at Bansberia based on “Kundalini and
            yogic concepts”. At that time rupees one lakh or more was spent in
            procuring marbles from a hilly area called Chunar situated near
            Benaras (Varanasi, U.P). Skilled artisans were also brought from
            this place to build up the temple. Unfortunately the King left for
            his heavenly abode in the year 1802 in the midway of construction of
            the temple. His queen Shankari took the initiative and the temple
            was completed in the year 1814.
