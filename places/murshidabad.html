          <p>
            During the 18th century, Murshidabad was a prosperous city. It was
            the capital of the Bengal Subah in the Mughal Empire for seventy
            years, with a jurisdiction covering modern-day Bangladesh and the
            Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. It was the seat of
            the hereditary Nawab of Bengal and the state's treasury, revenue
            office and judiciary. Bengal was the richest Mughal province.
            Murshidabad was a cosmopolitan city. Its population peaked at 10,000
            in the 1750s. It was home to wealthy banking and merchant families
            from different parts of the Indian subcontinent and wider Eurasia,
            including the Jagat Seth and Armenians. European companies,
            including the British East India Company, the French East India
            Company, the Dutch East India Company and the Danish East India
            Company, conducted business and operated factories around the city.
            Silk was a major product of Murshidabad. The city was also a center
            of art and culture, including ivory sculptors, Hindustani classical
            music and the Murshidabad style of Mughal painting.

          <h2 class="title">Hazarduari Palace</h2>
          <p>
            Hazarduari Palace, earlier known as the Bara Kothi, is located in
            the campus of Kila Nizamat in Murshidabad, in the Indian state of
            West Bengal. It is situated near the bank of river Ganga. It was
            built in the nineteenth century by architect Duncan Macleod, under
            the reign of Nawab Nazim Humayun Jah of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa
            (1824â€“1838). In 1985, the palace was handed over to the
            Archaeological Survey of India for better preservation. According to
            the Archaeological Survey of India as mentioned in the List of
            Monuments of National Importance in West Bengal, the Hazarduari
            Palace and Imambara ASI Listed Monuoments.
            <br /><br />
            The Hazarduari Palace was built in the 19th Century when Bengal was
            under the power of Nawab Nazim Humayun Jha. Duncan Macleod was the
            architect appointed for the construction of the palace, the
            foundation stone of which was laid in August 1829. The location
            where Hazarduari Palace is located was the site for the Nizamat Kila
            was demolished to build Hazarduari. The construction went on till
            1837. It is said that the foundation bed runs so deep that then
            Nawab had to take the aid of a ladder to go down and lay the
            foundation stone. The atmosphere that deep was so suffocating and
            the Nawab Fainted and had to be brought up. It was only after he
            came back to conscious that the foundation stone was laid. The
            enchanting palace is now considered as a Heritage Monument and is
            managed by the Archaeological Survey of India.

          <h2 class="title">Katra Masjid</h2>
          <p>
            The Katra Masjid is a former caravanserai, mosque and the tomb of
            Nawab Murshid Quli Khan. It was built between 1723 and 1724.[1] It
            is one of the largest caravanserais in the Indian subcontinent. It
            was built during the 18th century, when the early modern Bengal
            Subah was a major hub of trade in Eurasia. The Katra Masjid is
            located in the north eastern side of the city of Murshidabad, in the
            Indian state of West Bengal. The most striking feature of the
            structure are the two large corner towers having loopholes for
            musketry. The site is maintained and protected by the Archaeological
            Survey of India and the Government of West Bengal. According to the
            List of Monuments of National Importance in West Bengal, the Tomb
            and Mosque of Murshid Quli Khan (also Katra Masjid) are ASI Listed
            Monuments.
            <br /><br />
            Murshid Quli Khan on reaching old age, expressed his desire to
            construct his tomb adjacent to a mosque. He entrusted the
            responsibility for constructing the mosque to his trusted follower
            who was an architect, Murad Farash Khan. The total area is 19.5
            acres and can accommodate 2000 Namaz readers, that is the reason one
            can find 2000 squared type mats depicted on the floor, each of them
            used by a single Namaz reader.

            Chand, the head of the family, meaning "banker or merchant of the
