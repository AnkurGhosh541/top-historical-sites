          <p>
            Pāṇini mentioned a city named Gourpura, which by strong reason may
            be identified as the city of Gouda, ruins of which are situated in
            this district. Examples are legion of the relics of a predecessor
            kingdom being used in the monuments of the successor kingdoms. It
            had been within the limits of ancient Gour and Pandua. These two
            cities had been the capital of Bengal in ancient and medieval ages
            and are equidistant, north and south, from English Bazar town . The
            boundary of Gour was changed in different ages since the fifth
            century BC, and its name can be found in Puranic texts. Pundranagara
            was the provincial capital of the Maurya Empire. Gour and
            Pundravardhana formed parts of the Mourya empire as is evinced from
            the inscriptions, Brahmi script on a seal discovered from the ruins
            of Mahasthangarh in the Bogra District of Bangladesh.. The
            inscriptions discovered in the district of undivided Dinajpur and
            other parts of North Bengal, along with the Allahabad pillar
            inscriptions of Samudragupta, clearly indicate that the whole of
            North Bengal as far east as Kamrup formed a part of the Gupta
            Empire. After the Guptas at the beginning of seventh century AD
            Sasanka, the king of Karnasubarna, as well as the king of Gauda,
            ruled independently for more than three decades. From the middle of
            the eighth century to the end of the 11th century the Pala dynasty
            ruled Bengal, the kings were devoted to Buddhism. It was during
            their reign that the Jagadalla Vihara (monastery) in Barindri
            flourished paralleling with Nalanda, Vikramshila and Devikot.

          <h2 class="title">Adina masjid</h2>
          <p>
            The Adina Mosque is a former mosque in Malda District, West Bengal,
            India. It was the largest such structure in the Indian subcontinent
            and was built during the Bengal Sultanate as a royal mosque by
            Sikandar Shah, who is also buried inside. The mosque is situated in
            Pandua, a former royal capital. The vast architecture is associated
            with the hypostyle of the Umayyad Mosque, which was used during the
            introduction of Islam in new areas. The early Bengal Sultanate
            harbored imperial ambitions after having defeated the Delhi
            Sultanate twice in 1353 and 1359. The Adina Mosque was commissioned
            in 1373. Its construction reused materials from pre-Islamic Hindu
            and Buddhist structures.
            <br /><br />
            The mosque was built during the reign of Sikandar Shah, the second
            Sultan of the Ilyas Shahi dynasty of the Bengal Sultanate. The
            mosque was designed to display the kingdom's imperial ambitions
            after its two victories against the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th
            century. Stones from demolished Hindu temples were used in
            construction. A few parts of the mosque's exterior wall have
            carvings like elephants and dancing figures. Historians have
            considered whether the builders used stone from pre-Islamic
            structures or whether the mosque was built on the site of a
            pre-existing ruin. Inscriptions on the mosque proclaimed Sikandar
            Shah as "the exalted Sultan" and the "Caliph of the faithful". The
            Sultan was buried in a tomb chamber attached to the wall facing the
            direction of Mecca.

          <h2 class="title">Dakhil Darwaza</h2>
          <p>
            Dakhil Darwaza literally an entrance gate, (Ar. dakhil, Per.
            darwaza), is the largest structure of its kind in the architectural
            history of Sultanate Bengal. It was the main entrance to the citadel
            of lakhnauti, the Muslim name of gaur (per. Gawr). The gateway was
            the most solid and most elegant entrance portal ever erected in
            Bengal.
            <br /><br />
            The suggestion that it was erected by Sultan nasiruddin mahmud shah
            (1435-59 AD) at the time of the building of his citadel seems
            untenable. When the gateway of gunmant mosque, the city
            congressional mosque of the time of the restored Iliyas Shahis,
            could not be built to ensure that it could be reasonably
            time-enduring, how could such a strong and balanced structure like
            the Dakhil Darwaza be built at that timeFoodgrain We do not have a
            similar example even in pandua where the largest congressional
            mosque in Bengal was erected by the second Iliyas Shahi ruler, who
            is widely acknowledged to be the first great builder amongst the
            independent rulers of Bengal. The architecture of the gateway is an
            impressive one, and such an impressing structure could be built only
            when architecture has attained its full fruition. On this ground, it
            may be suggested that the Dakhil Darwaza was built in the Husain
            Shahi period. Antorio de Britto, the Portuguese interpreter (1521
            AD), speaks of 'a mosque round the corner in front of Dakhil
            Darwaza'.Hence the probability is that Alauddin husain shah, who was
            also the builder of the bara sona mosque, built the present gateway.
            The majesty of both the architectural pieces bring them at par in
            point of time. It is likely that the present gateway was s
            substitution of a weaker gateway built by Nasiruddin Mahmud Shah at
            the time of the erection of the citadel. Because of their weak
            construction similar inner gateways named Chand Darwaza and Nim
            Darwaza had vanished.

          <h2 class="title">Chika Mosque</h2>
          <p>
            Constructed in the 14th Century, Chika Mosque is located in Gaur,
            nearby to the fringe of the neighboring country- Bangladesh and in
            close proximity to the southwest to Qadam Rasul- which is another
            historical presentation.
            <br /><br />
            Externally, Chika Mosque or Chamkan Mosque resembles a Mosque or a
            Masjid. However, once you enter the Mosque, the absence of Mihrabs
            inside the building, the rows of huge pillars, and the use of
            elements from the Hindu Temple make. it evident that the building
            could not have been a mosque. Chamkan or Chika Masjid was
            constructed by Nasiruddin Mahmud Shah between 1435 and 1459 C.E.The
            Mosque constructed with the red terracotta bricks has an enormous
            single dome. Locally, the word “Chika” for the Mosque is derived
            from the local name for ‘bats’. Owing to the fact that long after
            the desertion and wrecking of Gaur, the Chamkan Mosque was filled by
            ‘chikas’ or ‘bats’.In the book written between 1879-1880, Major
            General Alexander Cunningham of the Royal Engineers asserts in his
            book about Gaur that Chamkan or Chika Mosque was certainly utilized
            as a prison or “chor-khana” by Sultan Hussain Shah(1493-1519 A.D).
            Despite being in ruins, the bats, however, are still very much
            there.

          <h2 class="title">Firoz Minar</h2>
          <p>
            Firoz Minar (also known as Firuz Minar) (English: Tower of
            Firoz/Firuz) is a five-storeyed tower situated at Gaur, West Bengal,
            India. It was built by Sultan Saifuddin Firuz Shah of the Habshi
            dynasty between 1485 and 1489. It was built in the Tughlaqi style of
            architecture. Although the first three storeys are dodecagonal, the
            final two are circular in shape.
            <br /><br />
            The minar was built by Sultan Saifuddin Firuz Shah of the Habshi
            dynasty. The construction started in 1485 and ended in 1489.
            Colloquially, the tower is referred as Pir Asa Mandir and Chiragh
            Dani. The tower also commemorates Firuz Shah's victories in the
            battlefield. According to tradition, Firuz Shah threw the chief
            architect from the topmost storey as he was not satisfied with the
            minar's height and wanted it to be taller.
            <br /><br />
            The minar resembles the Qutb Minar of Delhi. Firoz Minar is five
            storeyed structure. The first three stories are dodecagonal while
            the next two are circular in shape. The tower is 26 metres (85 ft)
            high and its circumference is 19 metres (62 ft). A spiral 73 step
            staircase leads to its top. Although there was a dome at the topmost
            storey, it has got replaced by a flat roof due to restoration work.
            The minar is built in Tughlaqi architecture and there are terracotta
            works on its walls. The tower sits on top of a masonry plinth.
