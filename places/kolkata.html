          <h2 class="title">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            In the late 17th century, the three villages that predated Calcutta
            were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty. After the
            Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690,[19]
            the area was developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified
            trading post known as Fort William. Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied
            Calcutta in 1756, and the East India Company retook it the following
            year. In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish
            native rule, and assumed full sovereignty of the region. Under the
            company rule and later under the British Raj, Calcutta served as the
            capital of British-held territories in India until 1911. In that
            year, after assessing its geographical location, combined with
            growing nationalism in Bengal (Calcutta became the centre for the
            Indian independence movement), the British moved the capital to the
            relatively more centrally located New Delhi.

          <h2 class="title">Victoria Memorial</h2>
          <p>
            The Victoria Memorial is a large marble building in Central Kolkata,
            which was built between 1906 and 1921. It is dedicated to the memory
            of Queen Victoria, now a museum under the auspices of the Ministry
            of Culture, and is the largest monument in the world which is
            dedicated to a royal. The memorial lies on the Maidan and is one of
            the famous monuments of Kolkata. <br /><br />
            In January 1901, on the death of Queen Victoria, then Lord Curzon,
            suggested the creation of a fitting memorial. Lord Curzon proposed
            the construction of a grand building with a museum and gardens.
            <br /><br />
            The Prince of Wales, laid the foundation stone on 4 January 1906,
            and it was formally opened to the public in 1921. In 1912, before
            the construction of the Victoria Memorial was finished, King George
            V announced the transfer of the capital of India from Kolkata to New
            Delhi. Thus, the Victoria Memorial was built in what would be a
            provincial city rather than a capital. The Victoria Memorial was
            mainly funded by British officials and individuals of India. The
            politicians and people of India responded generously to Lord
            Curzon's appeal for funds, and the total cost of construction of the
            monument, amounting to one crore, five lakhs of Rupees, was entirely
            derived from their voluntary subscriptions.

          <h2 class="title">Fort William</h2>
          <p>
            Fort William is a fort in Hastings, Calcutta (Kolkata). It was built
            during the early years of the Bengal Presidency of British India. It
            sits on the eastern banks of the Hooghly River, the major
            distributary of the River Ganges. One of Kolkata's most enduring
            Raj-era edifices, it extends over an area of 70.9 hectares. The fort
            was named after King William III. In front of the Fort is the
            Maidan, the largest park in the country. An internal guard room
            became the Black Hole of Calcutta. Today it is the Headquarters of
            Eastern Command of the Indian Army.
            <br /><br />
            Robert Clive started rebuilding the fort in 1758, after the Battle
            of Plassey (1757); construction was completed in 1781 at a cost of
            approximately two million pounds. The area around the Fort was
            cleared, and the Maidan became "the Lungs of Kolkata". It stretches
            for around 3 km in the north–south direction and is around 1 km
            wide. The Old Fort was repaired and used as a customs house from
            1766 onwards. The headquarters of the Indian Ordnance Factories was
            established in 1775 at Fort William. Today, Fort William is the
            property of Indian Army. The headquarters of Eastern Command is
            based there, with provisions for accommodating 10,000 army
            personnel. The Army guards it heavily, and civilian entry is
            restricted. Much of Fort William is unchanged, but St Peter's
            Church, which used to serve as a chaplaincy centre for the British
            citizens of Kolkata, is now a library for the troops of HQ Eastern
            Command. A war memorial has been created at the entrance of the
            fort, and the fort also houses a museum which displays artifacts
            from the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, especially those related to the
            battles in the Eastern sector and the Bangladesh Liberation War.

          <h2 class="title">St. Paul's Cathedral</h2>
          <p>
            In 1819, at the request of Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of
            Hastings – then Governor-General of Bengal – Royal Engineers officer
            William Nairn Forbes produced a design for the proposed cathedral;
            however, it was not accepted as it was deemed too expensive to
            build. Bishop Middleton suggested as a site for the new cathedral
            the part of the city now known as "Fives Court", where the cathedral
            now stands. In 1762 the area had been described as a forest so wild
            that it harbored tigers and at first it was regarded as "too far
            south" to serve as a location for the cathedral. Middleton died in
            1822 before building plans took shape. The next three bishops –
            Reginald Heber, Thomas James and John Turner – all died after brief
            tenures, and it was not until 1832, under Bishop Daniel Wilson, that
            the project to build the cathedral was revived.
            <br /><br />
            The architectural design of the cathedral is "Indo-Gothic", a Gothic
            architectural style designed to meet the climate of India. Following
            the 1897 earthquake and the subsequent massive earthquake of 1934,
            when Calcutta suffered substantial damage, the cathedral was
            reconstructed to a revised design. The cathedral complex has a
            library, situated over the western porch, and a display of plastic
            art forms and memorabilia.

          <h2 class="title">Shaheed Minar</h2>
          <p>
            The Shaheed Minar (English: Martyrs' Monument), formerly known as
            the Ochterlony Monument, is a monument in Kolkata that was erected
            in 1828 in memory of Major-general Sir David Ochterlony, commander
            of the British East India Company, to commemorate both his
            successful defense of Delhi against the Marathas in 1804 and the
            victory of the East India Company’s armed forces over the Gurkhas in
            the Anglo-Nepalese War, also known as the Gurkha War. The monument
            was constructed in his memory. It was designed by J. P. Parker and
            paid for from public funds.
            <br /><br />
            On 9 August 1969, it was rededicated to the memory of the martyrs of
            the Indian freedom movement and renamed the "Shaheed Minar," which
            means "martyrs' monument" in both Bengali and Hindi, by the then
            United Front Government in memory of the martyrs of the Indian
            independence movement. The present government has decided to
            illuminate the tower during evenings and allow visitors to the top.
            The last people to have been up there were former governor Gopal
            Krishna Gandhi and his family.
